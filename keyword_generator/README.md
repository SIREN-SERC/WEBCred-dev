Keyword Generator
=================

The Keyword Generator, created in collaboration with KB Researcher-in-residence Pim Huijnen, is a command-line tool that offers two methods to extract relevant keywords from a collection of sample texts provided by the user:

1) `keywords_tfidf.py`, extracting keywords based on tf-idf scores. Options:
 
- -k : number of keywords to be generated (default 10)
- -d : document length (the documents provided by the user will be split into parts containing the specified number of words; by default the documents will not be split.)
 
2) `keywords_lda.py`, extracting keywords based on either [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)'s or [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu)'s implementation of LDA topic modeling. Options:
 
- -t : number of topics (default 10)
- -w : number of words per topic (default 10)
- -k : number of keywords (default 10)
- -d : document length (the documents provided by the user will be split into parts containing the specified number of words; by default the documents will not be split.)
- m : mallet path (full path to the [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu) executable; if not provided, [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)'s LDA implementation will be used to generate topics.)

Documents are to be placed in the `data/documents` folder, stop word lists in the `data/stop_words` folder. The keyword lists and any topics and topic distributions generated will be saved in the `data/results` folder.

The Keyword Generator currently uses Python 2.7, and [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu) need to be installed locally.

Some examples of commands:
```
$ ./keywords_tfidf.py
$ ./keywords_tfidf.py -k 20 -d 100
$ ./keywords_lda.py -k 10 -d 100 -t 5 -w 20
$ ./keywords_lda.py -k 10 -d 100 -t 5 -w 20 -m /opt/mallet-2.0.7/bin/mallet
```
